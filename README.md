# DIAMONDS
It is a mini project on Python. DIAMONDS is a card game. There is a option that we can play as two players and three players.
First of all get four players together and choose a dealer who deals out all the cards. 
The object of the game is to basically beat out the others card. If two people play the same value card, they play the top card of their stock and whoeverâ€™s card has a higher value, they get the pile. 
Once all of the diamonds have been played, the game ends. 
"The game of diamonds is different from other trick-taking card games because when you cannot follow suit you get a suit action based on what suit you do pay."
